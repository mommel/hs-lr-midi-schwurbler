# Welcome to the Schwurbler Wiki!


**The Schwurbler** - a self-made MIDI controller for Lightroom. Launched by Manuel, this HS-Community project provides you with everything you need to create your own custom-made MIDI controller for Lightroom. Schematics, board layouts, settings for Midi2LR. It's all open source and everyone is invited to contribute. Sign up for the HS-Slack channel #der-schwurbler and participate. 

A special thanks to the following members of the HS-Slack Channel #der-schwurbler for their active participation and time to make the MIDI-Controller for Lightroom a reality.
