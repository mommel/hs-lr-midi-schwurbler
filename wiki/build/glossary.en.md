# Glossary

## BOM
Bill of materials, it is more or less the list which items you need to create a board

## MCU
The mcu is shorthand for microcontroller unit. When we speak of the mcu, we mostly mean a dev board. 
* Teensy is a dev board. 
* Esp32 is the chip itself but we mostly use it as synonym for the devboards with esp32-wroom chip like (TTGO, NodeMCU ESP32, ...)

## Midi2LR
MIDI2LR is a software application to translate the Schwurbler input to Lightroom actions.

## MVP
Minimal Valuable Product - This is a first working prototype.

## PCB
It is a Printed Circuit Board. The board where everything gets soldered onto. We use only through the hole soldering items to keep it beginner save. At least for the first board designs. You might want to have a look in this nice [guide how to solder right by Mitch Altmann, Andie Nordgren and Jeff Keyzer from mightyohm.com](http://mightyohm.com/files/soldercomic/FullSolderComic_EN.pdf)

## Potentiometer
A potentiometer is an electrical resistance component whose resistance values can be changed mechanically (by turning or shifting). There are linear potentiometers (faders or sliders) and rotary potentiometers.

## Rotary Encoder
A rotary encoder is a type of position sensor which is used for determining the angular position of a rotating shaft. It generates an electrical signal, either analog or digital, according to the rotational movement.

## Teensy
The Teensy is a USB-based microcontroller development system.
