`Customizing the MIDI Name`
This file has only one purpose, the definition of the device Name and Manufacturer name shown in the Usb and Midi Informations of your computer.
Editing the name is straightforward, the length must match to the number of characters, that's it.

`MIDI_NAME`
The Name of the Mididevice. The name of the Release/Milestone

`MANUFACTURER_NAME`
The Name of the Manufacturer shown. In our case always HappyShooting Community

`SERIAL_NUMBER`
Some random stuff, just because we can.
